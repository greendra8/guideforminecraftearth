                <p>If you choose to, you can invite other players to build on your build plates. Once they've joined, you'll be able to see their nametag above their heads, and the item that they're currently holding!</p>
                <p>Be careful however, as they can place and destroy any block on your build plate. Be sure to only add friends that you trust!</p>
                <p>Once your build is done, you can also place it in the real world, for everyone to see!</p>
