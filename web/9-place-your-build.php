                <p>Once youâ€™ve finished designing your Minecraft build plate, you can place it down in an open space at full-size, and walk in and amongst your creation.</p>
                <p>You can walk through your builds alone, or with friends. Everything can be interacted with. Mobs, blocks and all.</p>
                <p>Everything is still interactable, however any changes you make to your build won't be saved. So I guess what I'm saying is... TNT?</p>
