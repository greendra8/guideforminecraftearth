            <p>The most important item in Minecraft Earth are tappables. Tappables are your best friend when it comes to collecting new items.</p>
            <p>Tappables are collectible items in Minecraft Earth, which can be found randomly in the real world.</p>
            <p>To collect a tappable, just tap on the item once youâ€™re in range. Everyone shares the same tappables. For instance if you and a nearby friend open the same chest, you'll both get the exact same items!</p>
            <div class="tip">
                    <h4>PRO TIP!</h4>
                    <p>Every tappable you collect gains you experience points, which helps you to level up. This is the easiest and best way to level up early on in the game!</p>
                </div>
            <p>But take note that after a certain amount of time a tappable may disappear, and so it's best to tap them as soon as you're in range.</p>
