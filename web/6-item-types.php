                <p>In Minecraft Earth items are collected through tappables, as have already read. Some tappables are more rare than others, which shown by the colour of their outline.</p>
                <p>If an item is common, you're likely to find lots of them around the world. For instance, stone.</p>
                <p>However if an item is epic, then they'll be harder to find. For instance, a bucket of lava!</p>
                <div class="tip">
                    <h4>PRO TIP!</h4>
                        <p style="color:white; padding-bottom: 0;">White - Common</p>
                        <p style="color:greenyellow; padding-bottom: 0;">Green - Uncommon</p>
                        <p style="color:deepskyblue; padding-bottom: 0;">Blue - Rare</p>
                        <p style="color:mediumpurple;">Purple - Epic</p>
                </div>
                <p>On top of being able to collect blocks, you can also collect mobs. You can then place these mobs down in your world, and behave just as you'd expect!</p>
                <p>Special mob variants are found through clicking on a mob of the same type. Tap it and youâ€™ll be in for a chance of getting a rare variant! For instance, to collect a muddy pig you must first find a pig tappableâ€¦ but donâ€™t forget to keep those fingers crossed! ðŸ¤ž</p>
                <p>Water flows and fire spreads, so be careful to not burn down any of your creations! You won't be able to get destroyed blocks back, and you'll have to find them all over again!</p>
