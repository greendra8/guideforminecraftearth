               <p>Building in Minecraft Earth is split into two modes: build mode and play mode. And the first build mode is... build mode. What a creative name! :)</p>

            <h3 class="list-item-title">Build mode</h3>

               <p>In build mode, you can place down a build plate on a flat surface such as a table. Once placed, the plate becomes anchored to the surface it was put on.</p>
               <p>You can move around the build plate by walking in real life. For instance, to look at a build from above, you must position your phone above the build, and face it downwards towards the build plate.</p>
               <p>To build on a build plate, blocks can be placed by tapping on the side of another block, just like in regular Minecraft.</p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="list-item-title">Play mode</h3>
            <img class="list-item-image in-article" style="height: auto;" src="/img/play-mode-button.png">
            <div class="list-item-description">
                <p>The second mode is play mode. Here, you can place down your build plates at life-size. You can then walk in and amongst your Minecraft creation.</p>
                <p>Unless you live in a big house with lots of space, this mode is best played outside.</p>
                <div class="tip">
                <h4>PRO TIP!</h4>
                <p>Changes you make in Play Mode do not save. Any blocks you place or remove won't be saved, so feel free to go wild with TNT!</p>
