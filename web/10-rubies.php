                <p>Rubies are the new Minecraft Earth currency. They are found randomly in tappables, and can also be purchasable with real money.</p>
                <p>When you open a tappable, there is a random chance of getting a ruby. They aren't actually found inside the tappables, but are rewarded to you after opening them, much like XP.</p>
                <p>They're also not stored inside your inventory. You can see your ruby balance on the store page.</p>

            <div class="list-item-description">
                <p>Rubies are used to purchase items from the in-game store. Currently, you can only purchase build plates.</p>
                <p>In the future, however, rubies will be used to help speed up the time it takes to craft and smelt items!</p>
