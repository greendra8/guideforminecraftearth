            <div class="list-item-description">
                <p>Adventures are like small slices of core Minecraft, placed directly onto the real world.</p>
                <p>Within an adventure, you'll be able to mine through the ground to get cobblestone, chop down trees for wood, battle mobs, capture creature variants, and more.</p>
                <p>Adventures are where you might find some of the rarer building materials, such as diamonds.</p>
                <div class="tip">
                    <h4>PRO TIP!</h4>
                    <p>If you're sharing an Adventure with other players, every block mined during the encounter will be received by everyone in the group, so there's no need to dash around and fight over the loot.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Everything you collect, whether its building materials, mobs, or loot, goes straight into your inventory, which you can then use on Build Plates.</p>
                <p>Adventures pop up on the map just like tappable resources, and selecting them brings you into a life size build plate, full of rare materials, animals, and yes, even enemies like creepers and skeletons.</p>
                <p>Loading Adventures works a lot like loading build plates. When you select one on the map, youâ€™re given the option to choose which items to bring in, and brought to a camera viewer, which lets you place the adventure in front of you.</p>
                <p>Once an adventure is loaded, you and anyone else who joined it with you can start interacting with it, fighting enemies and mining resources.</p>
