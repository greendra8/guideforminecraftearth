            <div class="list-item-description">
                <p>Well, they’re pretty much the survival mode of Minecraft Earth. They involve exploration, fighting hostile mobs and mining for resources. Oh, and of course burning alive in lava.</p>
                <p>Dying in adventures, as you’d expect, causes you to lose all of the items that you’re carrying.</p>
                <p>But don’t worry, you’ll still keep all of the items you’ve collected from tappables. They’re kept separate. But things such as food, tools, and resources that you’ve mined will be dropped. So be careful!</p>
                <p>To take part in an adventure, you first have to find one. They spawn randomly around the world, but you’ll have to get close to one to be able to start! Once you’re in range, all you have to do is tap on the adventure icon shown on your map.</p>
                <p>You’ll be launched right into AR mode, where you’ll be placed inside a life-sized reconstruction of the adventure! Sometimes you’ll have to dig down to discover treasure, and other times you’ll play above ground! There will be mobs there too, so it’s a good idea to bring weapons with you.</p>
                <p>Adventures are where you’ll find the most precious loot, such as diamonds and emeralds. You can also capture mob variants here too, such as the Moobloom or the Muddy Pig! When you return home, you can then place these down on your build plates, just like you would with any other tappable.</p>
                <p>Adventures can also be played in multiplayer. If two or more people tap the same adventure, they’ll be able to explore and fight together! Don’t worry about being the first to loot though, because everything you collect will be added to everyone’s inventories. All of the loot is shared!</p>
                <p>There are also loads of different types of adventures. They’ll spawn in different biomes, with different structures, and different rewards! And the best part is, all of the content in them is randomised, so every adventure will be different.</p>
