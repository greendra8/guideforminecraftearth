            <h1>Profile</h1>
            <p>You can view your profile in Minecraft Earth by tapping on your player icon in the top left on the map screen.</p>
            <img src="/img/profile.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img">
            <p>Your profile overview tells you your players level and stats. Just below your characters skin you can see a progress bar and how much XP you need to level up.</p>
            <p>Below that are stats on things such as total blocks collected, items crafted and time played!</p>
            <h3>Skin customization</h3>
            <p>On the characters tab you can customise your players skins. In Minecraft Earth you can have up to 5 different skins at one time.</p>
            <img src="/img/skins.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img">
            <p>You can choose to either create a custom skin or to use one from a skin pack that you&#39;ve purchased previously.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You can also buy some of the cooler styles by using minecoins which can be purchased with real money on the Microsoft store.</p>
            <h3>Activity log</h3>
            <p>The next tab is the activity log. The activity log records all of your actions in Minecraft Earth. For instance when you open a tappable, its contents will be recorded in the log!</p>
            <p>Loot gained from adventures will also appear in the activity log.</p>
            <h3>Settings</h3>
            <p>The final tab is the settings tab. Here you can change the game volume and turn on features such as bright mode and precision mode.</p>
            <img src="/img/sign.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img">
            <p><strong>Precision mode</strong> adds a small marker to the centre of your screen when you&#39;re in AR mode. When you tap to place or destroy a block, it will only affect the area which the marker is over rather than the location that you&#39;ve tapped.</p>
            <p>There is also a <strong>battery saver mode</strong>. This mode will turn your screen to black when you hold your phone upside down (camera at the bottom) in order to try to save battery life. Your phone will still vibrate once you&#39;re in range of &nbsp;a tappable.</p>
