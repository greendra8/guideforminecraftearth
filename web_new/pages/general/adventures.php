            <h1>Adventures</h1>
            <p>Adventures are the survival part of Minecraft Earth. The part where you explore.&nbsp;</p>
            <img src="/img/adventure_crystals.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img">
            <p>You will see an Adventure on your in-game map. Get close and tap on it to enter. You will never know exactly what&rsquo;s in there, the contents are randomized.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It is a slice of a real Minecraft world in life-size on the ground. You dig down with your pickaxe or shovel, chop down trees. There might be mobs, and deep under the ground, you may find valuable ores, hidden treasures and other surprises!</p>
            <p>Every adventure has an <b>adventure chest</b>, which when broken drops loot. When the adventure chest is broken the adventure will close.</p>
            <img src="/img/adventure_chest_common.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img">
            <p>All the loot gained from an adventure is kept, and if you&#39;re playing with friends everyone will be rewarded with the same items.</p>
            <h2>Adventure Portals</h2>
            <p>There are two ways to enter into an adventure. The first is to find one in the real world, get close to it and tap on it to enter.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>These adventures are in fixed positions which sometimes means that they can sometimes be a bit awkward.&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Adventure Crystals</h2>
            <img src="/img/adventure_crystal_common.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img">
            <p>The other way to enter into an adventure is to use an adventure crystal. Adventure crystals can be placed down anywhere. Once placed they appear on the map (only for you) and can be tapped on to enter.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There are 5 different levels of difficulty of adventure crystal: common, uncommon, rare, epic, and legendary.</p>
            <img src="/img/adventure_rare.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img">
            <p>The easier the difficulty of the adventure crystal the smaller they are when placed, and so the more suitable they are for placing using indoors.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You can earn adventure crystals by logging in daily, completing the seasonal challenges, and also from other adventure chests.</p>
