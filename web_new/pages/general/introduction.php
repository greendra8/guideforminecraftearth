            <h1>An Introduction</h1>
            <p>A simple, short and sweet introduction to Minecraft Earth! Everything you need to know.</p>
            <img src="/img/earth.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img">
            <p>Minecraft Earth is an Augmented Reality mobile game for both Android and iOS devices. It was released
                worldwide in January 2020 and continues to receive frequent updates.</p>
            <p>To move in Minecraft Earth you must move around in the real world. Collectables, also known as
                <b>Tappables</b>, spawn in random locations around the globe. To collect them you have to walk towards
                them to be within range.</p>
            <img src="/img/muddy_pig.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img">
            <p>Tappables contain items, blocks and mobs. Minecraft Earth also contains special mob variants which aren't
                found in any other Minecraft game, such as the Muddy Pig shown above. These unique mob variants are vary
                rare to find.</p>
            <p>Adventures also spawn in random locations around the world, and are essentially mini-Minecraft battles at
                a life sized scale. Completing an adventure rewards you with both loot and experience points!</p>
            <p>The items you collect from both tappables and adventures can be used in your build plates. These are
                miniature chunks of the Minecraft world which can be placed down on a real life table top and built on!

            <p>There are also challenges and seasons to complete, which both offer unique rewards and help keep you busy
                when playing. Seasons last for 7 days and if completed offer a unique set of loot which won't ever be
                available again.</p>
