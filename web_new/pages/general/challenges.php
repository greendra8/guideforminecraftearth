            <h1>Challenges</h1>
            <p>Challenges in Minecraft Earth are tasks which offer you a reward once they&#39;re completed.</p>
            <img src="/img/challenges.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img">
            <p>You can view your challenges by tapping the trophy icon in the sidebar of the map screen.</p>
            <p>There are two types of challenges. Daily and tappable.</p>
            <h2>Daily challenges</h2>
            <p>Each day you will be given 3 daily challenges which are moderately difficult. They offer 50xp as a reward for completion.&nbsp;</p>
            <img src="/img/xp.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img">
            <p>Commonly daily challenges will be about collecting certain items from tappables or using an adventure crystal.&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Tappable challenges</h2>
            <p>Tappable challenges do not have a time limit and can be found after opening a tappable. They range in difficulty from easy to hard and offer XP rewards between 25-100xp.</p>
            <img src="/img/tappable_challenge_legendary.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img">
            <p>Tappable challenges can also be dismissed by tapping on their grey &#39;x&#39; icon. This frees up a slot so that you can get a new tappable challenge.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Just like daily challenges, you can only have 3 tappable challenges at one time.</p>
