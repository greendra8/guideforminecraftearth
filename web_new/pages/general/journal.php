            <h1>Journal</h1>
            <p>The journal in Minecraft Earth keeps track of all the items, blocks and mobs you&#39;ve ever collected and crafted.</p>
            <img src="/img/journal.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img">
            <p>You can access your journal by tapping on the book icon at the top of the left sidebar.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Just like your inventory, your journal has options to filter through the items. These include Mobs, Construction, Nature, Equipment, and Items (for everything else).</p>
            <p>You&#39;ll notice that your journal is full of items along with ones which are silhouetted. The silhouetted items are ones that you haven&#39;t found/crafted yet.</p>
            <img src="/img/pig_black.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img">
            <p>Your journal doesn&#39;t just help you keep track of the items you have and haven&#39;t collected, but it gives you the details and stats of them too.</p>
            <p>When you tap on an item you&#39;ll be given a short description of it along with details on how many you&#39;ve collected.</p>
            <p>For mobs, your journal also provides details on how much health they have, which biome they&#39;re found in and whether or not they&#39;re hostile.</p>
