            <p>First things first, you're going to need to download Minecraft Earth from the Google Playstore.</p>
            <p>Some devices aren't compatible with the game, so if when you search for Minecraft Earth no results appear, that will be the reason.</p>
            <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftearth&hl=en">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftearth&hl=en</a>
            <p></p>
            <p>Once you've installed Minecraft Earth, you'll need to login with your Microsoft account.</p>
            <p>This is so that Mojang can save all your progress and builds to the cloud! That means that no matter which device you're using, you'll be able to access all of your awesome creations!</p>
